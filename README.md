# Journal (blog) software written from scratch in PHP.

Similar working demo: https://rgp-journal.ru (old gotik.ru)

This php software was developed from scratch and was inspired by original Ilya "Justaman" version of gotik.ru 

Check the 2008 archive.org for: [rgp-journal.ru (gothic.ru)](https://web.archive.org/web/2008*/rgp-journal.ru), [darkdiary.ru](https://web.archive.org/web/2008*/darkdiary.ru) (different software, but similar idea), [journal.kmv.ru](https://web.archive.org/web/2008*/journal.kmv.ru), [uranruda.ru](https://web.archive.org/web/2010*/uranruda.ru), etc...

Have fun to use it if you want.
