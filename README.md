# Journal (blog) software written from scratch in PHP.

Similar working demo: https://rgp-journal.ru (old gotik.ru)

This php software was developed from scratch and was inspired by original Ilya "Justaman" version of gotik.ru 

Check the 2008 archive.org for: gotik.ru (gothic.ru project), rgp-journal.ru, darkdiary.ru (similar software), journal.kmv.ru, uranruda.ru, etc...

Have fun to use it if you want.
